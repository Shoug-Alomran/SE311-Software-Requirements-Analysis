# Sillah – Software Requirements Engineering (SE311)

This repository documents the Sillah project, an extended case study in **Software Requirements Engineering (SE311)** at Prince Sultan University.

Sillah is a preventive family health management system designed to help Saudi families:
- Record and track hereditary health conditions (e.g., cardiac disease, diabetes, hypertension, high cholesterol)
- Detect early risk patterns using rule-based analysis
- Access awareness content and preventive guidance
- Plan ahead with clinic appointment booking workflows

## From SE201 to SE311

Sillah was originally introduced in **SE201** as an initial requirements project (Vision & Scope, high-level requirements, and a basic prototype).

In **SE311**, the same project is expanded using advanced requirements engineering techniques:
- Formal documentation and structuring of requirements
- Detailed functional and non-functional requirements
- UML and scenario-based modeling (use cases, activity diagrams, class diagrams, etc.)
- Requirements validation, prioritization, and negotiation
- Traceability and requirements management across releases

## Documentation site (MkDocs)

The full documentation is organized as an **MkDocs** site, covering:
- Vision & Scope
- Business and system requirements
- Modeling and analysis
- Architectural views
- Prototype notes and evolution

To serve the documentation locally (if MkDocs is installed):

```bash
mkdocs serve
