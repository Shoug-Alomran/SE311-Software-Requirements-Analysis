### Mission

Build a prevention-first system that helps families move from reactive treatment to proactive risk awareness and early intervention.

</div>

<div class="home-card span-4" markdown>

### Problem Area

Inherited cardiac conditions are often identified late. Families need simple tools to capture health history and trigger preventive follow-up before critical events.

<div class="home-card span-4" markdown>

### Outcome

A documented software requirements baseline for a health prevention system, including validated scope, traceability, and testable requirements.
