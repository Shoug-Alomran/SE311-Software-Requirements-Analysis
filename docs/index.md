## Introduction

**Sillah (صلة)** is a preventive family health management system designed to help Saudi families identify hereditary cardiac risks and take proactive steps toward early detection. The system allows users to record family medical histories, detect inherited risk patterns, receive automated alerts, and simulate preventive clinic appointments.

The project was originally developed in **SE201**, where the focus was on defining the problem, identifying stakeholders, and establishing high‑level requirements. In **SE311**, Sillah is expanded using the full Requirements Engineering (RE) process described in Chapter 1:  
**Inception → Elicitation → Analysis → Specification → Validation → Requirements Management**.

This website documents the complete SE311 expansion of Sillah, demonstrating how structured requirements engineering techniques are applied to a real‑world e‑health system.

## Phases Overview

| Phase | Title                     | Description |
|-------|---------------------------|-------------|
| I     | Vision & Scope            | Problem definition, goals, stakeholders, and system boundaries |
| II    | Requirements Development  | Elicitation, analysis, functional & non‑functional requirements |
| III   | Modeling & Specification  | UML diagrams, goal modeling (GRL/URN), SRS documentation |
| IV    | Validation & Management   | Requirement validation, prioritization, traceability, and change management |

## Course Context

This project is developed for **SE311 – Software Requirements Engineering**, which focuses on:

- Requirements elicitation  
- Requirements analysis and modeling  
- Documentation standards (IEEE 830)  
- Goal modeling (GRL/URN)  
- Validation and negotiation  
- Requirements management and traceability  

Sillah serves as a complete case study demonstrating the full lifecycle of Requirements Engineering as taught in SE311.
