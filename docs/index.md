## :heart: Project Introduction

**Sillah (صلة)** is a preventive family health management system designed to help Saudi families identify hereditary cardiac risks and take proactive steps toward early detection.

The system enables users to:

- Record structured family medical histories  
- Detect inherited cardiac risk patterns  
- Receive automated alerts and preventive recommendations  
- Simulate preventive clinic appointment workflows  

Originally developed in **SE201**, the project focused on problem definition, stakeholder identification, and high-level requirement formulation.

In **SE311**, Sillah evolves into a fully engineered requirements project following the complete Requirements Engineering lifecycle:

**Inception → Elicitation → Analysis → Specification → Validation → Requirements Management**

This site documents the structured expansion of Sillah using formal RE methods, modeling techniques, and documentation standards.

## :triangular_ruler: Project Phases

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

- ### Phase I — Vision & Scope  
  Definition of the problem domain, business goals, stakeholder analysis, and system boundaries.

- ### Phase II — Requirements Development  
  Requirements elicitation, analysis, prioritization, and definition of functional and non-functional requirements.

- ### Phase III — Modeling & Specification  
  UML diagrams, goal modeling (GRL/URN), domain modeling, and full Software Requirements Specification (SRS) documentation.

- ### Phase IV — Validation & Management  
  Requirement validation techniques, prioritization strategies, traceability matrices, and change management processes.

## :brain: Course Focus

SE311 emphasizes disciplined and structured Requirements Engineering, including:

- Stakeholder analysis and elicitation techniques  
- Conflict resolution and negotiation  
- UML and goal-oriented modeling  
- IEEE 830 documentation standards  
- Requirements validation and verification  
- Traceability and lifecycle management  

Sillah serves as a comprehensive case study demonstrating how formal Requirements Engineering transforms an initial idea into a complete, validated, and traceable system specification.
