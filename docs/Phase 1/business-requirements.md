# 1. Business Requirements

## 1.1 Background
Inherited cardiac diseases are increasingly common in Saudi Arabia, yet many cases can be prevented through early detection. Most families lack a structured way to track health history or identify hereditary risks.  
**Sillah** addresses this gap by providing a preventive e‑health platform that documents family health records, screens for hereditary conditions, and supports early action through clinic booking and awareness tools.

## 1.2 Business Opportunity
Aligned with **Vision 2030**, Saudi Arabia is prioritizing preventive healthcare and digital transformation. Currently, no unified family‑centric system exists that:

- Tracks hereditary cardiac conditions  
- Automatically detects risk patterns  
- Provides personalized alerts  
- Connects users to clinics  
- Offers culturally relevant awareness content  

Sillah fills this national gap with a scalable, bilingual, accessible platform.

## 1.3 Business Objectives
- Increase early detection of hereditary cardiac risks.  
- Provide a user‑friendly tool for recording and analyzing family health data.  
- Reduce long‑term healthcare costs through preventive action.  
- Support national health initiatives through potential system integration.  
- Deliver a functional prototype demonstrating feasibility.

---

## 1.4 Success Metrics
- ≥ 80% onboarding completion rate.  
- Family tree creation in under 5 minutes for ≥ 15 users.  
- Risk alerts with ≤ 1% false negatives on test data.  
- System Usability Scale (SUS) ≥ 80.  
- 99% simulated notification delivery success.  
- Fully validated bilingual interface.

## 1.5 Vision Statement
Sillah empowers Saudi families to take control of their hereditary health by offering an intelligent, culturally aligned platform that identifies risks related to cardiac disease, diabetes, hypertension, high cholesterol, and other inherited conditions.  
The system envisions a future where preventive health awareness becomes a household standard, reducing avoidable medical outcomes and strengthening early detection culture.

## 1.6 Business Risks
- **User Adoption Risk:** Users may hesitate to share sensitive health data.  
- **Data Quality Risk:** Inaccurate entries may reduce risk‑detection accuracy.  
- **Clinical Alignment Risk:** Medical guidelines evolve and require updates.  
- **Competitor Risk:** Future national platforms may overlap with Sillah.  
- **Technology Risk:** Real clinic integration requires advanced infrastructure.  
- **Usability Risk:** Poor UX may reduce engagement.

Mitigation strategies include strong UX design, privacy messaging, and modular architecture.
