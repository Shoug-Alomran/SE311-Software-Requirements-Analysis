# 1.1 Introduction

The **Sillah (صلة)** project is a preventive family health management system designed to help Saudi families identify hereditary cardiac risks through an intuitive digital platform. The system enables users to record family health histories, detect inherited risk patterns, receive automated alerts, and simulate preventive clinic appointments.

Originally developed in **SE201**, Sillah focused on defining the problem, identifying stakeholders, and establishing the high‑level requirements needed to support preventive health awareness. That phase represented the **Inception** stage of the Requirements Engineering (RE) process.

In **SE311 – Software Requirements Engineering**, the project is expanded using the full RE process described in Chapter 1:  
**Inception → Elicitation → Analysis → Specification → Validation → Requirements Management**.  
This phase emphasizes formal documentation (IEEE 830), advanced elicitation techniques, UML and goal modeling, requirements validation, prioritization, and traceability across multiple releases.

This document reflects the evolution of Sillah from a basic SE201 proposal into a complete, professionally structured requirements specification aligned with SE311 learning outcomes.

# 1.2 Project Overview

## 1.2.1 Goals
1. Strengthen **Preventive Health Awareness** by supporting early detection of hereditary conditions.  
2. Enhance **Family Health Tracking** through structured data entry and improved usability.  
3. Improve **Risk Detection Accuracy** using refined rule‑based logic and validated requirements.  
4. Support **Healthcare Integration** through clearer workflows and stakeholder‑driven requirements.  
5. Enable **Scalable Public Health Solutions** through well‑defined, maintainable requirements.

## 1.2.2 Objective
To formally document and refine the requirements of a preventive health system that allows citizens to record family health data, analyze hereditary patterns, and take proactive steps toward cardiac screening — using advanced SE311 requirements engineering methods.

## 1.2.3 Main Features
- Manage family members and health events with structured data models.  
- Detect hereditary risk patterns using validated rule‑based logic.  
- Deliver personalized alerts and recommendations.  
- Provide an awareness hub with curated educational content.  
- Simulate clinic appointment booking workflows.  
- Support role‑based access for citizens, providers, and administrators.

## 1.2.4 Users
- **General Citizens:** Record family data, view alerts, and access awareness content.  
- **Healthcare Providers:** Review risk summaries and appointment requests.  
- **Administrators:** Manage awareness content, system rules, and platform updates.  
- **Public Health Stakeholders (Future):** Analyze aggregated trends for preventive programs.
