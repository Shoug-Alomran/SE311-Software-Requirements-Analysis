# 1.1 Introduction

## :heart: Sillah (صلة) — Preventive Family Health Management System

Sillah (صلة) is a preventive family health management system designed to help
Saudi families identify hereditary cardiac risks through an intuitive digital
platform. The system enables users to record family health histories, detect
inherited risk patterns, receive automated alerts, and simulate preventive
clinic appointments.

Originally developed in **SE201**, the project focused on defining the
problem, identifying stakeholders, and establishing high-level requirements to
support preventive health awareness. That phase represented the **Inception**
stage of the Requirements Engineering process.

In **SE311 – Software Requirements Engineering**, the project expands into a
complete requirements lifecycle:

**Inception → Elicitation → Analysis → Specification → Validation → Requirements Management**

This phase emphasizes formal documentation (IEEE 830), advanced elicitation
techniques, UML modeling, prioritization, and traceability across multiple
releases.

## 1.2 Project Overview

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   ### :dart: Goals

    Strengthen preventive awareness and enable early detection of hereditary
    conditions through structured, scalable system design.

    Improve family health tracking, risk detection accuracy, and healthcare
    integration using validated requirements and refined rule-based logic.

-   ### :material-bullseye: Objective

    Formally document and refine the requirements of a preventive health
    system that allows citizens to record family data, analyze hereditary
    patterns, and take proactive steps toward cardiac screening using
    structured SE311 engineering practices.

-   ### :sparkles: Core Features

    - Structured management of family members and health events  
    - Automated hereditary risk detection logic  
    - Personalized alerts and recommendations  
    - Awareness and educational content hub  
    - Appointment booking workflow simulation  
    - Role-based access control  

-   ### :busts_in_silhouette: User Groups

    - **General Citizens** — Record data and receive alerts  
    - **Healthcare Providers** — Review summaries and requests  
    - **Administrators** — Manage rules and system content  
    - **Public Health Stakeholders (Future)** — Analyze aggregated trends

## :thinking: System Perspective

Sillah is not just a mobile application or web platform. It is a
requirements-driven preventive health system built around structured data
collection, rule-based evaluation, and stakeholder-centered workflows. The
project demonstrates how disciplined requirements engineering improves clarity,
traceability, and long-term maintainability.
