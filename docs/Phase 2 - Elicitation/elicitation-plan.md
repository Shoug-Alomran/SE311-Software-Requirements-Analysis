The objective of the elicitation process is to refine the Phase 1 Vision and Scope into structured and traceable user requirements for the initial release of Sillah.

Specifically, the elicitation aims to:

- Confirm bilingual usability requirements (Arabic RTL / English LTR).
- Identify security and privacy expectations in alignment with the Personal Data Protection Law (PDPL).
- Capture preventive health alert and recommendation expectations.
- Produce a prioritized and evidence-supported set of user requirements.
