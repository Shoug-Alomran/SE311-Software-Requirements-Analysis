# 2. Elicitation Plan

This section defines the structured approach used to elicit, refine,
and validate user and stakeholder requirements for the initial release
of *Sillah (صلة)*.

The elicitation process builds directly upon the Vision & Scope defined
in Phase 1 and translates business objectives into structured,
traceable user requirements.

---

## 2.1 Objectives

The primary objective of elicitation is to transform high-level
business requirements into well-defined, prioritized, and evidence-
supported system requirements.

Specifically, the process aims to:

- Clarify detailed family user workflows and preventive-health scenarios  
- Validate rule-based hereditary risk detection expectations  
- Confirm bilingual usability requirements (Arabic RTL / English LTR)  
- Identify security and privacy expectations in alignment with PDPL  
- Capture expectations regarding preventive alerts and recommendations  
- Produce a traceable and prioritized set of user requirements  

---

## 2.2 Elicitation Techniques

Multiple complementary techniques were used to ensure balanced
stakeholder input and requirement validation.

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

- ### :material-account-voice: Interviews

    Conducted with family users and a healthcare provider to
    understand preventive-health workflows, privacy concerns,
    and usability expectations.

    Purpose: Extract qualitative functional and non-functional requirements.

- ### :material-clipboard-text-outline: Bilingual Survey

    Distributed to gather usability preferences and interface
    expectations across a broader user sample.

    Purpose: Validate patterns and identify preference trends.

- ### :material-file-document-outline: Document Analysis

    Reviewed PDPL regulations and preventive-health guidelines.

    Purpose: Identify regulatory constraints and compliance requirements.

- ### :material-eye-outline: Observation & Competitive Review

    Analyzed current informal health-tracking behaviors and
    competing platforms.

    Purpose: Identify gaps and differentiation opportunities.

## 2.3 Participants

The elicitation process involved the following stakeholder categories:

- Family Members (Primary End Users)  
- Healthcare Providers  
- Survey Respondents (General Users)  

Regulatory and public-health perspectives were addressed through
document analysis rather than direct interviews.

---

## 2.4 Expected Outputs

The elicitation process is expected to produce:

- Structured functional requirements  
- Non-functional requirements (security, usability, reliability)  
- Prioritized requirement list  
- Evidence-backed requirement traceability  
- Identified conflicts and resolution notes

## 2.5 Risks and Mitigation

| Risk | Potential Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|------------------|--------------------|
| Incomplete interview data | Weak requirement clarity | Cross-validation with survey responses |
| Conflicting stakeholder expectations | Requirement ambiguity | Consolidation discussions and prioritization |
| Scope expansion | Delays and requirement creep | Restrict to Phase 1 objectives |
| Privacy concerns | Reduced participation | Clarify anonymity and confidentiality |
| Response bias | Misleading usability assumptions | Use mixed techniques (interviews + survey) |
