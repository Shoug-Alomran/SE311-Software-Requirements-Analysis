# 9. Document / Observation / Competitive Analysis

## 9.1 Document Analysis

The SDAIA Privacy Policy and national data protection standards were reviewed to identify legal and security requirements applicable to the Sillah system.

The policy specifies that personal data collection must be based on user consent and that users have the right to access, correct, delete, and withdraw consent. It also mandates secure storage within the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and prohibits unauthorized data sharing.

These principles justify the system’s secure authentication, role-based access control, restricted data visibility, and secure data storage requirements.

## 9.2 Observation Notes

Families currently track hereditary health information using informal methods such as memory, paper notes, or fragmented mobile applications. There is no centralized digital system focused specifically on hereditary preventive tracking.

This observation supports the need for structured family profile management and preventive alert functionality.

## 9.3 Competitive Review

Existing health platforms primarily focus on appointment booking or electronic medical records but do not emphasize hereditary risk tracking and personalized preventive alerts for families.

This gap supports the uniqueness of the Sillah platform’s preventive-health focus.
