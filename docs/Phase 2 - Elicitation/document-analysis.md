## 9.1 Document Analysis

### :material-file-document-outline: Regulatory Review

National data protection standards and SDAIA privacy policies were
reviewed to identify legal and security requirements relevant to Sillah.

Key regulatory principles identified:

- Personal data collection must be based on explicit user consent  
- Users have the right to access, correct, delete, and withdraw consent  
- Personal data must be securely stored within the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia  
- Unauthorized data sharing is prohibited  

### Derived Requirements

These findings justify the inclusion of:

- Secure authentication mechanisms  
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)  
- Restricted data visibility policies  
- Secure storage and encryption measures  
- Consent management functionality  

### Sources

- SDAIA Privacy Policy  
- Ministry of Health Awareness Platform  
- WHO Resources

## 9.2 Observation Notes

### :material-eye-outline: Current User Behavior

Informal observation and background research indicate that families
currently track hereditary health information using:

- Personal memory  
- Paper notes  
- Fragmented mobile applications  
- General health apps without hereditary focus  

There is no centralized digital system dedicated specifically to
structured hereditary preventive tracking.

### Derived Requirements

This observation supports:

- Structured family profile management  
- Health event recording functionality  
- Automated risk-detection logic  
- Preventive alert generation

## 9.3 Competitive Review

### :material-domain: Market Landscape

Existing health platforms primarily focus on:

- Appointment booking  
- Electronic medical records (EHR)  
- General health tracking  

However, they do not emphasize:

- Hereditary risk pattern detection  
- Family-based health modeling  
- Personalized preventive alerts  

### Strategic Insight

This gap reinforces the differentiation of Sillah as a
family-centric preventive-health platform.
