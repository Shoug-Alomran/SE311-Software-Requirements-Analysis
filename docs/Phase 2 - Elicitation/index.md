# Phase 2 — Requirements Elicitation

Phase 2 transforms the high-level Vision & Scope defined in Phase 1
into structured, evidence-based, and traceable user requirements.

This phase corresponds to the **Elicitation** stage of the Requirements
Engineering lifecycle and focuses on discovering stakeholder needs,
constraints, expectations, and priorities.

Multiple elicitation techniques were applied to ensure comprehensive
requirement coverage and reduce ambiguity.

## :material-magnify-scan: Elicitation Approach

The following techniques were used to gather and validate requirements:

- Semi-structured stakeholder interviews  
- Bilingual usability survey  
- Regulatory document analysis (PDPL)  
- Observation of current health-tracking behaviors  
- Competitive platform review  

All extracted requirements are:

- Documented using a consistent specification format  
- Categorized as functional or non-functional  
- Prioritized using the **MoSCoW** method  
- Linked to supporting evidence for traceability
