# 1. Business Requirements

## 1.1 Background
Inherited cardiac diseases are increasingly common in Saudi Arabia, yet many cases can be prevented through early detection. Most families lack a structured way to track health history or identify hereditary risks.  
**Sillah** addresses this gap by providing a preventive e‑health platform that documents family health records, screens for hereditary conditions, and supports early action through clinic booking and awareness tools.

---

## 1.2 Business Opportunity
Aligned with **Vision 2030**, Saudi Arabia is prioritizing preventive healthcare and digital transformation. Currently, no unified family‑centric system exists that:

- Tracks hereditary cardiac conditions  
- Automatically detects risk patterns  
- Provides personalized alerts  
- Connects users to clinics  
- Offers culturally relevant awareness content  

Sillah fills this national gap with a scalable, bilingual, accessible platform.

---

## 1.3 Business Objectives
- Increase early detection of hereditary cardiac risks through structured family health data collection.
- Provide a user-friendly digital tool for recording and analyzing family health data.
- Reduce long-term healthcare costs through preventive action.
- Support national health initiatives through potential integration with public health systems.
- Deliver a functional prototype demonstrating technical and operational feasibility.


---

## 1.4 Success Metrics
- ≥ 80% onboarding completion rate.  
- Family tree creation in under 5 minutes for ≥ 15 users.  
- Risk alerts with ≤ 1% false negatives on test data.  
- System Usability Scale (SUS) ≥ 80.  
- 99% simulated notification delivery success.  
- Fully validated bilingual interface.

## 1.5 Vision Statement
Sillah empowers Saudi families to proactively manage hereditary health risks through an intelligent, culturally aligned preventive e-health platform. The system envisions a future in which preventive health awareness becomes a household standard, reducing avoidable medical outcomes and strengthening early detection practices.

## 1.6 Business Risks
- **User Adoption Risk:** Users may hesitate to share sensitive health data.
- **Data Quality Risk:** Inaccurate entries may reduce risk-detection accuracy.
- **Clinical Alignment Risk:** Medical guidelines evolve and require periodic updates.
- **Competitor Risk:** Future national platforms may overlap with Sillah.
- **Technology Risk:** Real clinic integration requires advanced infrastructure.
- **Usability Risk:** Poor user experience may reduce user engagement.

Mitigation strategies include user-centered interface design, transparent privacy communication, and a modular system architecture that supports incremental enhancement.
