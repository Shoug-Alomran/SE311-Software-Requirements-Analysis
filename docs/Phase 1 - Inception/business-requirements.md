# 1. Business Requirements

This section defines the business-level drivers, objectives, and constraints
that justify the development of the Sillah system.

---

## 1.1 Background

Inherited cardiac diseases are increasingly prevalent in Saudi Arabia,
yet many cases can be mitigated through early detection and preventive action.
Most families currently lack a structured mechanism to document medical history
or identify hereditary risk patterns.

**Sillah** addresses this gap by providing a preventive e-health platform that:

- Records structured family health data  
- Screens for hereditary cardiac conditions  
- Generates automated risk alerts  
- Supports early action through clinic booking and awareness tools  

---

## 1.2 Business Opportunity

Aligned with **Vision 2030**, Saudi Arabia is prioritizing preventive
healthcare and digital transformation initiatives.

Currently, no unified family-centric system exists that simultaneously:

- Tracks hereditary cardiac conditions  
- Detects risk patterns automatically  
- Provides personalized preventive alerts  
- Connects users to healthcare providers  
- Delivers culturally aligned awareness content  

Sillah fills this gap with a scalable, bilingual, mobile-first platform.

---

## 1.3 Business Objectives

The primary objectives of Sillah are to:

- Increase early detection of hereditary cardiac risks through structured data collection  
- Provide a user-friendly tool for recording and analyzing family health history  
- Reduce long-term healthcare costs through preventive intervention  
- Support national health initiatives through future system integration  
- Deliver a functional prototype demonstrating technical and operational feasibility  

---

## 1.4 Success Metrics

Project success will be evaluated using measurable criteria:

- ≥ 80% onboarding completion rate  
- Family tree creation in under 5 minutes (≥ 15 test users)  
- Risk alerts with ≤ 1% false negatives on validation data  
- System Usability Scale (SUS) ≥ 80  
- 99% simulated notification delivery success  
- Fully validated bilingual interface  

---

## 1.5 Vision Statement

Sillah empowers Saudi families to proactively manage hereditary health risks
through an intelligent, culturally aligned preventive e-health platform.

The long-term vision is to normalize preventive health awareness at the
household level, reducing avoidable medical outcomes and strengthening
early detection practices across the Kingdom.

-   ### :material-account-alert-outline: User Adoption Risk
    Users may hesitate to share sensitive health data.

-   ### :material-database-alert-outline: Data Quality Risk
    Inaccurate or incomplete entries may reduce risk-detection accuracy.

-   ### :material-hospital-box-outline: Clinical Alignment Risk
    Medical guidelines evolve and require periodic system updates.

-   ### :material-domain: Competitor Risk
    Future national platforms may overlap with Sillah’s functionality.

-   ### :material-chip: Technology Risk
    Real clinic integration requires advanced infrastructure.

-   ### :material-emoticon-sad-outline: Usability Risk
    Poor user experience may reduce engagement and retention.

## 1.7 Business Assumptions & Dependencies

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   ### :material-cellphone: Technology Assumptions
    Users possess smartphones and stable internet access.  
    Cloud hosting and secure APIs may be required for scaling.

-   ### :material-account-group-outline: Cultural Assumptions
    Families are willing to document shared health history.

-   ### :material-function-variant: Prototype Assumption
    Rule-based risk detection is sufficient for initial implementation.

-   ### :material-shield-check-outline: Regulatory Dependency
    Compliance with Saudi PDPL is mandatory.

-   ### :material-hospital-building: Integration Dependency
    Future clinic integration depends on institutional cooperation.

-   ### :material-book-open-outline: Content Dependency
    Awareness material requires validated medical sources.
