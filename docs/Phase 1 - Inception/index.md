# Phase 1 — Vision & Scope

Phase 1 establishes the strategic and structural foundation of the
*Sillah (صلة)* project.

This phase corresponds to the **Inception** stage of the Requirements
Engineering (RE) lifecycle as defined in SE311.

The goal of this phase is to clearly define:

- The business problem  
- The opportunity and justification  
- The system vision  
- Stakeholders and constraints  
- Project boundaries and limitations  

A well-defined Vision & Scope reduces ambiguity, aligns stakeholders,
and prevents uncontrolled requirement expansion in later phases.
